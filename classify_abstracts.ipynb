      "1) 1 the presenceabsence of a species at a particular site is the simplest form of data that can be collected during ecological field studies we used 13 years 1990 1990 of survey data to parameterize a stochastic patch occupancy model for a metapopulation of the yellow bellied marmot in colorado and investigated the significance of particular patches and the influence of site quality network characteristics and regional stochasticity on the metapopulation persistence 2 persistence of the yellow bellied marmot metapopulation was strongly dependent on the high quality colony sites and persistence probability was highly sensitive to small changes in the quality of these sites 3 a relatively small number of colony sites was ultimately responsible for the regional persistence however lower quality satellite sites also made a significant contribution to long term metapopulation persistence especially when regional stochasticity was high 4 the northern network of the marmot metapopulation was more stable compared to the southern network and the persistence of the southern network depended heavily on the northern network 5 although complex models of metapopulation dynamics may provide a more accurate description of metapopulation dynamics such models are data intensive our study one of the very few applications of stochastic patch occupancy models to a mammalian species suggests that stochastic patch occupancy models can provide important insights into metapopulation dynamics using data that are easy to collect\n",

      "5) to combine the rational use of marine benthic resources and economic development of small scale fishers chile passed legislation in 1991 establishing a comanagement policy that grants exclusive territorial user rights for fisheries turfs to artisanal fisher organizations in well defined inshore coastal areas known as management and exploitation areas for benthic resources meabrs in general the policy has been proclaimed a management and economic success because benthic resource abundances have increased inside meabrs in comparison with open access areas however there is a lack of studies assessing the impact of this management policy on nontargeted subtidal species and community assemblages and the policy's implications for biodiversity and conservation this study starts to fill this gap and links the allocation of turfs for benthic resources with add on conservation benefits for species that are not directly linked with the fishery policy comparative subtidal surveys inside vs outside meabrs were used to assess the effects of three meabrs on managed targeted benthic species biodiversity species richness and community assemblages in central chile surveys focused exclusively on subtidal kelp forest habitats dominated by lessonia trabeculata spanning 4 12 m in depth and with similar levels of habitat complexity the study comprised 1 quantification of kelp forest complexity 2 understory survey of sessile species 3 quantification of conspicuous benthic macroinvertebrates including those under management and 4 quantification of reef fish species inside the kelp habitat results showed population enhancement of target managed invertebrates inside meabrs moreover reef fish species were significantly more diverse and abundant inside meabrs and community assemblages of nontarget benthic invertebrates and reef fish were significantly different inside vs outside meabrs the comanagement of inshore benthic resources in chile through meabrs aims for the sustainability of invertebrate and algae stocks however our study shows that this management tool which in practice restricts access to the entire management area provides important conservation add on effects for species that are not the focus of the management policies therefore in chile the hundreds of already established meabrs could represent an important ancillary network which complements the biodiversity objectives of fully protected areas such as no take marine protected areas or others\n",
